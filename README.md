This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Brief

As an individual technical challenge, I have been tasked with building a tool for drafting 5-a-side football teams. This drafting process should be randomized in some way, but a stretch challenge is to introduce a mechanic for team balancing.

I will be building my solution as a web-based react/redux application. These technologies are the most suited in my current skill-set to buliding single/few page application with some interactive features.

Name: Hannah. 
 
age : 29

education: Undergraduate degree
	
Works as a teacher in secondary school. 

As a teacher, Hannah is always short on time. She organises a bi-monthly 5-a-side game for some of the female members of staff. Drafting and balancing the teams manually can be fiddily job that takes up precious time.  

Technology : Hannah is computer literate, particulary in office/doc software, which she uses on a daily basis to plan/resource lessons. She's very comfortable with email comms and shares links/docs on a variety of SMPs very regulary. 

She has a Samsung S7 and personal MacBook, but uses the slightly sluggish windows desktops during her workday. 

Based on this, I have defined the following user stories for our MVP:

“As a user, I want to be able to draft and balance two side-a-side teams a head of a match in a few minutes. Ideally, I could also share the finished teams with the other players, and possibly quickly print a hardcopy of the listings" 


###  
 
 
Stretch goals
Although we were limited to a one-week deadline, if time allowed, we planned to implement the following advanced features on completing the MVP:
Return exercise descriptions and diagrams/images with the custom workout
User login functionality
The ability for the user to log completed workouts and view their workout history
Improve the app’s UI: add progress charts and a calendar view to sync with the user’s workout history
